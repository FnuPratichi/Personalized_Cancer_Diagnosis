# Personalized Cancer Diagnosis

## 1. Business Problem

### 1.1 Description

The goal of this project is to build a model that classifies genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. 
This is part of the **MSK-Redefining Cancer Treatment** competition, where the challenge is to utilize clinical text data and genetic information to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment.

#### Problem Statement:
The task is to classify the given genetic variations/mutations using evidence from clinical literature, which can potentially aid in personalized cancer treatment. 
This can significantly enhance decision-making by providing insights into how specific genetic mutations are linked to cancer progression and treatment response, allowing for better-tailored therapies.


## Objective

The primary objective is to accurately classify genetic variations and mutations based on evidence extracted from clinical text data. These predictions can be used to inform cancer diagnosis and provide personalized treatment plans.
